**Why?**    
Being a long time basketball hobbyist and NBA fan,   
it is just very natural for me to sniff around NBA   
datasets and hopefully I can find something interesting  
(at least to myself) with the help of data science teniques.  


**Huge thanks to** 
Those who create Python, Jupyter Notebook and other open-source libraries.
Those who collect and share datasets.  


**How will these projects progress or evolve?**  
Basically each ipynb file will (at least try to) answer  
a specific question regarding NBA games, teams or players.  
And hopefully I will not make too many embrassing mistakes  
and learn something along the way while being able to have 
a little bit fun.
